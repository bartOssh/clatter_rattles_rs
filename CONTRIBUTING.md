# Contributing

- Contributors are welcome. Suggestions and ides are welcome too.
- For now this project is more about fun and learning how to build libs for Rust Language then real usage but not assuming it is empty work.
- I will maintain the project in small steps if needed. So do not expect to much features if any. I will see.
